Problem Statement
In tier â…” cities a lot of locals, small grocery shop owners are feeling the heat because of the delivery services like Amazon Pantry and bigger supermarkets like Vishal Mega Mart, EasyDay foraying into the grocery business and eating up a lot of market by providing competitive pricing of the products and/or doorstep delivery.

While aggregators and doorstep delivery services exist for restaurants and sweetmeat shops in the form of zomato, swiggy eetc, there is still a scope of a serious player in the grocery/FMCG items space.

This product targets this area.

Next Steps

    Primary area would be Market Rx. But of course we don't have time for this. 

    So our target is to come up with a working website that would be able to do the following - 

    Onboard shops
    Allow shop owners to maintain/manage inventory
    Allow the shops to list their inventory 
    Allow the inventory to be presented as a catalog
    Onboard Buyers
    Allow the Buyers to look at the available shops
    Allow the Buyers to look at the listed products
    Allow the Buyers to buy the products
    Reports/Analytics/Charts
    ..
    ..
    .
    .
    .
